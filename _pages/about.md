I am a Mendenhall Postdoctoral Fellow in the [Data Science Branch](https://www.usgs.gov/mission-areas/water-resources/science/data-science-water-resources?qt-science_center_objects=0#qt-science_center_objects) of the United States Geological Surveyâ€™s Water Mission Area. I received my PhD from the University of Notre Dame in 2017, under the supervision of [Stuart Jones](https://www3.nd.edu/~sjones20/). My research is aimed at describing aquatic biogeochemical processes and predicting how these processes may respond to future global change. Currently, my research focuses on producing short-term forecasts of lake and stream temperature at regional scales. I also help lead a [Wikipedia editing group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Limnology_and_Oceanography) that aims to improve the quality and quantity of free aquatic information.
