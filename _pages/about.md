I am a Mendenhall Postdoctoral Fellow in the [Data Science Branch](https://www.usgs.gov/mission-areas/water-resources/science/data-science-water-resources?qt-science_center_objects=0#qt-science_center_objects) of the United States Geological Surveyâ€™s Water Mission Area. I received my PhD from the University of Notre Dame in 2017, under the supervision of Stuart Jones. My research program is aimed at describing aquatic biogeochemical processes and predicting how these processes may respond to future global change. I employ a variety of techniques, including whole-lake manipulation, observational studies, and statistical, simulation, and geospatial modeling to address questions related to aquatic ecosystem functioning across many temporal and spatial scales.
